            <h4>PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION</h4>
            <p>Raptorfolk are people descended from and sharing ubiquitous characteristics with ancient pack predators. They themselves are precursors to the varied species of birds-of-prey that exist today. As such, Raptorfolk take the form of humanoid beings mostly covered in a thick coat of short, bristle-like feathers that may be striped, spotted, or splotchy in pattern. Their long, rounded snouts, forearms, and lower legs are devoid of this covering, instead bearing a scaled hide. Most are colored in subdued, earthy tones, though males tend to be more brightly colored, and often sport a crest-like mane of feathers that reacts with the Raptorfolk's mood. Their bright colors serve to attract mates and show off their virility. Their eyes are often green or yellow in color, with a smaller number featuring blue or violet hues.</p>
            <p class="indent"></p>
            <h4>HISTORY</h4>
            <p>Raptorfolk likely were created alongside the dinosaurs towards the end of the sarrukh kingdom's reign during the days of thunder. Like the yuan-ti, they were probably humans who lived before the age of man came to be. Creatures like lizardfolk and dragons existed, but dinosaurs were a deadly mix of the two. From the mix came the raptors, who were small and fast wicked little things. The sarrukh experimented on the humans, mixing the races. The Raptorfolk were thus created. They did not enjoy life too long as soon the sarrukh fell and the yuan-ti usurped power. The deity of the yuan-ti was cruel and the Raptorfolk fled from his influence, refusing to worship him. They found refuge outside the reaches of Mhairshaulk, where they lived in relative fear and seclusion. When the god became unresponsive and other races assailed the empire, the Raptorfolk quickly surrendered to incoming human forces and swore them aid. After the battle was over, Raptorfolk were free to walk with the humans, though the yuan-ti never forgot their perceived betrayal.</p>
            <p class="indent"></p>
            <h4>SOCIETY</h4>
            <p>Raptorfolk often live in temperate or warm rainforests in tribes. However, thanks to the bravery and deeds of their ancestors, they can venture forth to other settlements and cities without fear of stigma. In a way, they are regarded as dragonfolk. Raptorfolk are all too eager to interact, trade with, and assist different peoples, assuming that no hostile intent is shown to them. They are thought to be timid in new environments, despite their eagerness. At the back of their mind usually lurks the wonder of what evil thoughts another creature may be scheming. As such, divination magic into another creature's thoughts is a highly praised skill in Raptorfolk society. This timidness does not change the fact that, when threatened, Raptorfolk are capable combatants. Predatory instinct still lays behind every Raptorfolk's fierce intellect, and the pack mentality that otherwise allows their society to thrive through teamwork becomes a fierce weapon when turned to face a foe. Through skillful coordination and the viciousness of any assault, even a small group of Raptorfolk warriors can defeat larger or more numerous foes. Like lizardfolk, they are resourceful creatures and masters of their home terrain. </p>

            <h4>Raptorfolk Names</h4>
            <p>There is a dichotomy to Raptorfolk names. While males usually take more musical, sibilant names, females are usually given harsher-sounding names with hard consonants.</p>
            <p class="indent"></p>
