    <description>
      <p class="flavor">When you mention the word "kitsune" the local populace, the general reaction will be annoyance or fear. It is rightly so. My folk are known as tricksters with no morality by human standards. It also doesn't help that some of my kind were corrupted by the Abyss and turn them away from Inari's teaching. These were called nogitsune. The nogitsune only added the flame of racism against us. It was inevitable that the human populous would commit a genocide and banned the teachings of Inari. After a century of hiding, the fox has exited its burrow. Years of suffering by humanity are finally over. Due to many years of hard work, I finally achieved trust to other mortals of this plane.</p>
		<p class="indent">— Katsumi, Zenko kitsune of Inari</p>
      <h4>APPEARANCE</h4>
      <p>In their natural form kitsune are anthromorphic foxes with diditigrade limbs. Kitsune have fur in various shades of red and brown with the rarity of black and white. Their eyes hyave vertical slit pupils that have an arrange of colors from cobalt blue to golden yellow. They also have a tail that helps them balance. Due to their diditigrade limbs they have a hard time wearing shoes like a human. Most kitsune wear getas or sandals while their in human form. Claws, while more pronounced than a normal humans fingernails, are impractical to use in combat due to the victim having a shallow scratches as a result. Their fangs on the other hand are deadly if one is not careful. The kitsune uses fangs as a last resort in close quarters combat.</p>
      <p class="indent">Nogitsune are the same as their kitsune brethren except that they have black fur and blood red eyes. Their fangs are a lot more deadly than ordinary kitsune. They use their fangs to drain the life-force of the target and feed on it to heal their wounds.</p>
      <h4>MENTAL POWER</h4>
      <p>Kitsune have great mental fortitude that is on par with the high elves. They have remarkable cunning that they use solve problems in the most unlikely solutions imaginable. Due to their familiarity to illusions and enchantments, kitsune often use honeyed words or pranks to oppose their enemies instead of the sword. They can use what humans called 'foxfire', a harmless blue flaming orb that floats on the ground. Skilled kitsune can weave illusions using this ability.</p>
      <h4>TAILED SCION</h4>
      <p>Kitsune are descendants of their nine-tailed Deity Inari. While its not uncommon to see a kitsune with multiple tails. It is very rare for kitsune to acquire their ninth tails. Kitsune can gain additional tails through hard work and enlightenment. In special circumstances Inari rewards tails to kitsune who has done a good deed. The amount of tails also shows the amount of authority they have in the kitsune political structure.</p>
      <h4>SHAPESHIFTING</h4>
      <p>Due to their nature, kitsune had an inborn ability to take a form of a human or that of a feral fox. Their human form is unique as their natural form. They can shapeshift into a specific human of the same gender. Like humans, both natural and human forms are heredity. Most kitsune in their natural/human form are people from Wa in Kara-Tur. Some kitsune master their shapeshifing art to the point where they can shift into a fox or shift into a person they have seen recently.</p>
