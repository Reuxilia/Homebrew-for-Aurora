      <h4>CROCADILIAN</h4>
      <p>A crocodile sat crying By the river one fine day. His tears fell in the water And were swiftly swept away; But as he sat there crying, From the corner of his eye, He looked around most carefully To see what would pass by. Swimming in the river Was a juicy little frog, Who thought the weeping crocodile Was just a fallen log. He hopped out of the water For a rest there by its side, But as he settled down he saw The crocodile who cried. ”Come closer,” said the crocodile, And wipe away my tear.” The frog jumped backwards quickly And he answered, “No-NO! my dear. I’m sure you’d like to eat me For I know your little game.” And he jumped back in the water And was never seen again. Now listen, little animals, Here’s something you should know, Beware the weeping crocodile, His tears are all for show!: Unknown Elfish poem.</p>
      <h4>PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION</h4>
      <p>The crocodilians are humanoid crocodiles that lurk in swamplands. Their tendency to fight can be reflected by their physical appearance. They have a reptilian layer of scales that cover their bodies and a large snout which conceals rows of dangerously sharp teeth. Their hands and feet are also outfitted with sharp claws. They are frequently mistaken as overly-muscular lizardfolk with their thick tails and reptilian appearance.</p>
      <p class="indent"></p> 
      <h4>HISTORY</h4>
      <p>Crocodilians are a rare species related to lizardfolk. They live in swamps that men have learned to avoid, usually for good reason. Little is known about their history because they don't care enough to pass it on. However, through an intensive study by scholars, it is now known that crocodilians used to be the rulers of the lizardfolk until their kingdom was overthrown. It seems as though a rebellion formed against them because of their ruthless nature.</p>
      <p class="indent"></p>
      <h4>SOCIETY</h4>
      <p>Crocodilians live in swampy villages and prefer to be left alone. While they may seem large and fierce, they have a soft side to them that takes years of trust to appear. When they're around those that they have known for a long time, they are rather gentle creatures and care dearly for their allies. Because of their physical appearance, they are often times mistaken as overly-muscular lizardfolk. Crocodillians take pride in their race and will take great offense to those mistaking them as lizardfolk.</p>
