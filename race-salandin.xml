            <p>The Salandin are a relatively shy race, living deep in jungles, rainforests and swamps. Other races refer to them as Salamanders, or Salamanderfolk. Technically this is a misconception, but the Salandin have made no efforts to correct it.</p>

            <h4>SOCIETY</h4>
            <p>Salandin live in close-knit communities. Depending on where they call home, their communities could be on the ground, in makeshift floating villages, or up in the tree canopies where they are safe from most predators.</p>
            <p class="indent"></p>
