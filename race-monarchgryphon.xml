            <h4>DESCRIPTION</h4>
            <p>Powerful and Intelligent avian carnivores, similar to their Savage relatives, the Griffins. Monarch Gryphons are unique in that they leave their young to raise and fend for themselves until they reach an applicable age to re-enter their hidden society. These Gryphons also grow at relatively high rates early in their lives, reaching full maturity within a few years to months, depending on how much food they consume. Monarch Gryphons are Proud creatures, and even infants have quite a bit of esteem. Like their Savage counterparts, Monarch Gryphons are also very Vicious creatures, whom tend to dislike any whom are not one of their own. </p>
