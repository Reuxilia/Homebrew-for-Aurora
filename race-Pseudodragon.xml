        <description>
            <p>A pseudodragon is a small dragon-kin known to be playful but shy. Pseudodragons are not true dragons, but are highly valued for their use as wizard's familiars. Pseudodragons resemble cat sized dragons with a sinuous stinger at the end of their prehensile tail. They stand in a quadruped stance, but have articulate hands or talons. </p>
            <h4>HISTORY</h4>
            <p>A God of Knowledge found their kind to have potential, then deciding to grant some a boost of intellect. The newly enlightened pseudodragons grouped together and ventured into the world; some mages attempted to take some of these more intelligent pseudodragons as familiars but were met with ferocity as the pseudodragons wanted to have their own lives, thus many became mages themselves in order to prevent themselves from becoming familiars or to spite the norm of spellcasters.</p>
            <h4>SOCIETY</h4>
            <p>As with normal pseudodragons, they revel in knowledge and such many of superior intellect choose to become mages and thus are often found in associated places. They generally don't have their own culture, choosing to learn and involve themselves with another race's or order's society. This means that individual pseudodragons can have vastly different customs and ideals to one another.</p>
			<h4>PSEUDODRAGON NAMES</h4>
			<p>Many pseudodragons of this variety draw from the Draconic language like the dragonborn but also draw from notable scholarly figures or create derivations of deities that they align with in honor of them.</p>
